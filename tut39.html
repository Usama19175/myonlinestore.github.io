              <h2> Studs</h2>
              <p id="paragraph">It wasn't until the 1950s when adidas introduced boots with interchangeable screw-in studs, which were made of rubber or plastic, this meant that depending on the weather and pitch conditions, players could have different studs on the same pair of boots. Original boots were heavy and high-ankled, but a lighter boot with less protection became popular in South America and Southern Europe where pitches were less muddy and harder and this style eventually became used everywhere. Boots just came in one colour for many years, black. Recently with new production materials and techniques and the popularity of boots as a fashion and consumer item, any colour has been possible.

                When did football boots start, why and what years were certain features such as studs, blades, leather boots introduced? well the time line below should help you get an idea into the history of footy boots and the future of football boots will also be looked into.</p>
